My Marketing Funnel Analysis: A Learning Journey
Internship Project @ Future Interns (Task 3)
The Goal
For this final task, I wanted to understand how data moves through a sales funnel. I didn't just want to make a chart; I wanted to learn how to clean messy, real-world data and turn it into something a business can actually use to make decisions.

What I Built & Learned
This project was a great way for me to practice using Python and Power BI together. I realized that data is almost never "ready to use" when you first get it.

1. Data Engineering in VS Code
I started by using Python to get the dataset under control.

Cleaning: I had to map text values like "success" and "droppedoff" into a numerical format (1s and 0s). This was a big learning moment for me in terms of data transformation.

Verification: Before moving to visuals, I wrote a script to calculate the conversion rate manually. I hit an 11.70% conversion rate, which gave me a baseline to check my dashboard math against.

2. Visualizing in Power BI
After cleaning the data, I imported it into Power BI to build an interactive report.

Troubleshooting: I ran into a few "Data Type" errors where Power BI didn't recognize my numbers correctly. Learning how to use Power Query to force these changes was one of the most useful parts of this project.

The Result: I created a funnel chart that shows exactly where the biggest "drop-offs" are happening.

My Top Insights
The "Success" Metric: We are converting leads at 11.70%.

Segment Analysis: I noticed that while "Blue-collar" jobs bring in the most leads, "Students" actually have a higher conversion efficiency.

Communication Matters: My analysis showed that cellular outreach was significantly more effective than landlines for this campaign.
