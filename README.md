Task 1

I have created and used Python programs to examine a retail dataset with sales of about $2.29 million. Key company KPIs, regional performance trends, and category profitability have all been aided by this analysis.

Important revelations include:

The profit margin is 12.47%, and the total revenue is roughly $2, 297, 200.86.
When compared to other regions, the West has the biggest sales volume.
In order to increase the profit margins, I advise concentrating marketing efforts on the West region and streamlining the furniture category.
VS Code/Jupyter Notebooks and Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) are among the tools utilised.# FUTURE_DS_01
